# Iterators and Closures

* Closures, a function-like construct you can store in a variable
* Iterators, a way of processing a series of elements
* How to use closures and iterators to improve the I/O project in Chapter 12
* The performance of closures and iterators (Spoiler alert: theyâ€™re faster than you might think!)
